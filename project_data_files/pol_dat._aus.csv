States and territories are able to move between the steps on the pathway at different times, in line with their current public health situation and local conditions.
   
Step 1 will focus on carefully reopening the economy, and giving Australians opportunities to return to work and social activities, including gatherings of up to 10 people, up to 5 visitors in the family home and some local and regional travel.
   
Step 2 builds on this with gatherings of up to 20, and more businesses reopening, including gyms, beauty services and entertainment venues like galleries and cinemas.
   
Step 3 will see a transition to COVID safe ways of living and working. Arrangements under step 3 will be the ‘new normal’ while the virus remains a threat. International travel will remain restricted. There is no limit on the number of people who are permitted to gather indoors, however there must be 4sqm per person, with hygiene and social distancing measures.
