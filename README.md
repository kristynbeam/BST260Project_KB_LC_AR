Goal of the project

How do they navigate the files in our repo...
Instructions:
1. Look at the RMD and HTML files `file.html`
2. Run our shiny app `app.R`

Data files are:
1. `data1.csv`
2. `data2.csv`

Don't have to give a description of what is in each of these csv files

This READMD needs to just have instructions about how to navigate the project.
